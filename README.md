## How to use
### Telegram
Search the docs by simply sending a message following this pattern: 

`<search for these words> @openSUSE_docs_bot`

or 

`/docs <search for these words>`

Use `/stats` to get some use statistics, and `/start` to bring up this very message.

### Web
GET endpoints can be reached at: 
- `https://opensuse-docs-bot.herokuapp.com/search/<your keywords>` for searching the docs; and
- `https://opensuse-docs-bot.herokuapp.com/stats` for getting statistics about usage on Telegram, [go there now](https://opensuse-docs-bot.herokuapp.com/stats).

Please note that querying the docs from the web does not log any stats.
